Easy to Use, Multi-Purpose Tool. Dynamic, Integrated Platform. Persistent, Dependable, Accurate Solver Technology. Powerful Nonlinear and Linear Solvers.</span> 
<br />
</p>
<h2><strong>Features</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fast solvers: </strong>Mechanical Includes multiple solver technologies that run in parallel and scale efficiently. GPU technology can also be leveraged for additional parallel computing power.</li>
<li><strong>Linear Dynamics: </strong>Modal, harmonic response, random vibration, and spectrum response (seismic or shock) can be solved with Mechanical.</li>
<li><strong>Acoustics: </strong>Conduct acoustic simulations to better understand the vibroacoustic behavior of systems, with or without structural pre-loading. Though, pre-loading adds authenticity and allows for the simulation of self-weighted, fastened assembly and even squealing breaks.</li>
<li><strong>Nonlinearities: </strong>In addition to the linear response, users can simulate the behavior of elastic materials as they undergo plastic or even hyperelastic deformation materials like metals and rubber. Viscoelastic response can also be simulated. Nonlinear simulation within Ansys Mechanical also takes into account contact and large deflection of moving parts relative to each other, with or without friction. These capabilities are robust in static or time-domain transient simulations.</li>
<li><strong>Thermal and Heat Transfer:</strong> Robust steady-state and transient thermal capabilities are included with all levels of Mechanical licenses. Heat transfer via conduction, convection, and radiation are supported. Thermal loading can also be readily transferred from Ansys’ CFD and electromagnetics solvers to Mechanical.</li>
<li><strong>Fatigue and Fracture:</strong> Extensive fatigue life and damage calculation capabilities are readily available in Ansys Mechanical. Combining fatigue life and fracture mechanic methods allows users to effectively predict the service life of their products and avoid costly warranty issues.</li>

<br />
</p>
<h2><span style="color: #202124;">Benefits</span></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Solid Edge Portfolio: </strong><span style="color: #424242;">Solid Edge is now a start-to-finish PLM tool that allows users to implement the best solution for their company’s and customer’s needs. This portfolio includes a variety of tools, including simulation, manufacturing, technical publications, data management and applications from third-party software, truly offering unique design-through-manufacturing possibilities.</span></li>
<li><strong>Scalable Data Management:</strong> Built-in Solid Edge data management allows manufacturers to work with a large volume of CAD files. The Design Manager tool enables users to review and edit the properties of multiple files and to backup, share and synchronize files through a number of cloud-based, file-sharing software. Should the need arrive, Siemens allows for an easy upgrade to Teamcenter. Teamcenter Integration for Solid Edge allows users to capture, manage and share Solid Edge data.</li>
<li><strong>Design Collaboration:</strong> <span style="color: #424242;">The product collaboration of SolidWorks helps designers share their project with other key stakeholders, and offers a variety of ways to protect data and original design.</span></li>
<li><strong>Next Generation Design:</strong> <span style="color: #424242;">Generative Design is a feature just added to the 2017 version of SolidWorks. Other improvements to SolidWorks’ design include closing the gap between design and manufacturing with more intelligent designs, predicting next steps.</span></li>
<li><strong>Sheet Metal Modeling:</strong> <span style="color: #424242;">SolidWorks provides a basic version of sheet metal modeling. Users can design a sheet metal part on its own without any reference to the parts it will enclose, the part in the context of an assembly or the part within a multibody environment.</span></li>
<li><strong>Assembly Optimization:</strong> <span style="color: #424242;">Because of the history-based functionality of SolidWorks, creating assemblies requires users to build and understand each individual part before creating the whole. And if a customer requires modifications to an assembly, the user will have to modify each part, then make required adjustments to other parts, and possibly the entire assembly.</span></li>
<li><strong>3D Digital Prototypes:</strong> <span style="color: #424242;">Solid Edge users can build complete 3D digital prototypes and optimize their designs before the production stage, and design an entire assembly with specific machined, cast or stylized components.</span></li>
<li><strong>Creating 3D Models from 2D Drawings:</strong> <span style="color: #424242;">Solid Edge allows users to create quality 3D models from 2D drawings, and 2D drawings from 3D models. With both functions, Solid Edge provides multiple view options, including standard, auxiliary, section, detail, broke and isometric.</span></li>
<li><strong>True Direct Editing:</strong> <span style="color: #424242;">Solid Edge’s Synchronous Technology allows users to create and modify a design on the fly, irrespective of the order in which previous elements were assembled. This makes the design more responsive and allows for design changes at the assembly stage. With this feature, users can design, revise and deliver a product faster.</span></li>
<li><strong>One-Shot, Multi-Part Editing:</strong> <span style="color: #424242;">The one-shot editing of Solid Edge allows users to edit components in an assembly while also maintaining the original design intent of the product or feature. A user can select multiple faces of multiple parts and make quick edits. Synchronous Technology will recognize symmetrical parts of a feature and make corresponding edits when there are any alterations.</span></li>

CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.</span> 
<br />
</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Opportunity in Web designing: If anyone wants to begin a career in web designing professionally, it is essential to have knowledge of CSS and HTML.</li>
<li><strong style="color: #504b3a">Website Design: </strong>With the use of CSS, we can control various styles, such as the text color, the font style, the spacing among paragraphs, column size and layout, background color and images, design of the layout, display variations for distinct screens and device sizes, and many other effects as well.</li>
<li><strong style="color: #504b3a">Web Control: </strong>CSS has controlling power over the documents of HTML, so it is easy to learn. It is integrated with the HTML and the XHTML markup languages.</li>
<li><strong style="color: #504b3a">Other Languages: </strong>Once we have knowledge of some basics of CSS and HTML, other associated technologies like Angular, PHP, and JavaScript have become clearer to understand.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<h2>Advantages of CSS:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>CSS saves time:</strong> <span style="color: #000000;">You can write CSS once and then reuse the same sheet on multiple HTML pages. You can define a style for each HTML element and apply it to as many Web pages as you want.</span></li>
<li><strong>Pages load faster:</strong> <span style="color: #000000;">If you are using CSS, you do not need to write HTML tag attributes every time. Just write one CSS rule of a tag and apply it to all the occurrences of that tag. So less code means faster download times.</span></li>
<li><strong>Easy maintenance: </strong><span style="color: #000000;">To make a global change, simply change the style, and all elements in all the web pages will be updated automatically.</span></li>
<li><strong>Superior styles to HTML: </strong><span style="color: #000000;">CSS has a much wider array of attributes than HTML, so you can give a far better look to your HTML page in comparison to HTML attributes.</span></li>
<li><strong>Multiple Device Compatibility:</strong> <span style="color: #000000;">Style sheets allow content to be optimized for more than one type of device. By using the same HTML document, different versions of a website can be presented for handheld devices such as PDAs and cell phones or for printing.</span></li>
<li><strong>Global web standards: </strong><span style="color: #000000;">Now HTML attributes are being deprecated and it is being recommended to use CSS. So it''s a good idea to start using CSS in all the HTML pages to make them compatible with future browsers.</span></li>

[10-Jun-2022 13:24:38 UTC] <p>Java is a language for programming and a forum. Java is a high-level, robust programming language that is object-oriented and stable. In 1995, Java was developed by Sun Microsystems (which is now Oracle''s subsidiary).Java is a general-purpose, class-based, object-oriented programming language designed for having lesser implementation dependencies. It is a computing platform for application development. Java is fast, secure, and reliable, therefore. It is widely used for developing Java applications in laptops, data centers, game consoles, scientific supercomputers, cell phones, etc. One of the most widely used programming languages, Java is used as the server-side language for most back-end development projects, including those involving big data and Android development. Java is also commonly used for desktop computing, other mobile computing, games, and numerical computing.

<li><strong>Performance:</strong> PHP script is executed much faster than those scripts which are written in other languages such as JSP and ASP. PHP uses its own memory, so the server workload and loading time are automatically reduced, which results in faster processing speed and better performance.</li>
<li><strong>Open Source: </strong>PHP source code and software are freely available on the web. You can develop all the versions of PHP according to your requirement without paying any cost. All its components are free to download and use.</li>
<li><strong>Familiarity with the syntax: </strong>PHP has easily understandable syntax. Programmers are comfortable coding with it.</li>
<li><strong>Embedded:</strong> PHP code can be easily embedded within HTML tags and scripts.</li>
<li><strong>Platform Independent:</strong> PHP is available for WINDOWS, MAC, LINUX &amp; UNIX operating systems. A PHP application developed in one OS can be easily executed in another OS also.</li>
<li><strong>Database Support: </strong>PHP supports all the leading databases such as MySQL, SQLite, ODBC, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Error Reporting:</strong> PHP has predefined error reporting constants to generate an error notice or warning at runtime.</li>
<li><strong>Loosely Typed Language:</strong> PHP allows us to use a variable without declaring its data type. It will be taken automatically at the time of execution based on the type of data it contains on its value.</li>
<li><strong>Web servers Support:</strong> PHP is compatible with almost all local servers used today like Apache, Netscape, Microsoft IIS, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Security:</strong> PHP is a secure language to develop the website. It consists of multiple layers of security to prevent threats and malicious attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Control: </strong>Different programming languages require long scripts or code, whereas PHP can do the same work in a few lines of code. It has maximum control over the websites like you can make changes easily whenever you want.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<h2><strong>Advantages:</strong>  </h2>
<ol>
<li>The most important advantage of PHP is that it’s open-source and free from cost. It can be downloaded anywhere and is readily available to use for events or web applications. </li>
<li>It is platform-independent. PHP-based applications can run on any OS like UNIX, Linux, and Windows, etc. </li>
<li>Applications can easily be loaded which are based on PHP and connected to the database. It’s mainly used due to its faster rate of loading over slow internet speed than other programming language. </li>
<li>It has less learning curve because it is simple and straightforward to use. Someone familiar with C programming can easily work on PHP. </li>
<li>It is more stable for a few years with the assistance of providing continuous support to various versions. </li>
<li>It helps in reusing an equivalent code and not got have to write lengthy code and sophisticated structure for events of web applications. </li>
<li>It helps in managing code easily. </li>
<li>It has powerful library support to use various function modules for data representation. </li>
<li>PHP’s built-in database connection modules help in the connecting database easily reducing trouble and time for the development of web applications and content-based sites. </li>
<li>The popularity of PHP gave rise to the various communities of developers, a fraction of which may be potential candidates for hire. </li>
<li>Flexibility makes PHP ready to effectively combine with many other programming languages in order that the software package could use foremost effective technology for every particular feature.</li>
